In this section, the problem of multistream classification with domain adaptation problem is finalized, and the challenges of conducting an adaptive classification performance over drifting data streams is deliberated.

\subsection{Notations and Problem Statement}
\label{subsec: problemstatement}

In Table~\ref{tab:notations}, frequently used symbols in this paper are listed. There are two 
continuous stream of data instances generated from source domain $D_{s}$ and target domain $D_{t}$.
A data instance is denoted as $(x, y)$, where $x$ is a vector (m-dimensional in 
source stream \& n-dimensional in target stream),and y is the 
corresponding label. In the source stream, both $x_{s}$ and $y_{s}$  are available, while in the target domain only $x_{t}$ is available. Therefore, a multistream classification with domain adaptation problem can be described as follows:

Suppose $X_{s}$ is a set of m-dimensional vectors and $Y_{s}$ is the corresponding label in source stream from a certain domain $D_{s}$, 
while $X_{t}$ is a set of n-dimensional vectors in target stream from another 
domain $D_{t}$. In our problem setting, m $\neq$ n. The objective is to construct a classifier $M$ that
predicts class labels of $x_{t} \in X_{t}$ using $X_{s}$, $Y_{s}$ and $Y_{t}$.

\subsection{Challenges}
The the problem setting of multistream classification with domain adaptation, there are two major challenges at the same time.
The first challenge is the adaptation of both source and target domain. Since source data cannot be directly used as training data to learn the target task, 
how to
